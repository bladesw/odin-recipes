        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Tres leches cake is a favorite Costa Rican recipe- and the most delicious 
                dessert. It's a sponge cake baked from scratch with sugar, flour, eggs 
                and vanilla. Add three types of milk- evaporated milk, heavy cream and 
                sweetened condensed milk and top with whipped topping for an incredibly 
                rich flavor.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 eggs, room temperature and separated yolk from the whites</li>
                <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
                <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 cup white flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1 cup sweetened condensed milk (leche condensada)</li>
                <li>1 cup evaporated milk  (leche evaporada)</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Separate the egg yolks from the whites for each of your eggs.</li>
                <li>In your mixer or mixing bowl, add the egg yolks and beat, using a whisk attachment, 
                    on medium speed until the yolks turn a pale yellow.</li>
                <li>While mixing the yolks, measure out dry ingredients into a medium bowl (flour, baking 
                    powder and salt) into a bowl and whisk until combined.</li>
                <li>Next, add 1/3 cup milk and vanilla to the egg yolk mixture and stir. Pour the whole 
                    thing over the flour mixture and stir until just combined.</li>
                <li>In a separate large bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 
                    1/4 cup sugar and beat until stiff peaks form (forme picos).</li>
                <li>Add the egg white mixture to the flour mixture and stir. Your cake batter should be 
                    light and airy. Pour into your baking pan and place in the center rack of the oven.</li>
                <li>Bake this cake for about 20 to 25 minutes. It is done when a toothpick inserted comes 
                    out clean- up to about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the cake is baking, you can stir or whisk together the three kinds of milk for 
                    the sauce.</li>
                <li>Allow to cool slightly- the cake will be spongy and the sides of the cake will naturally 
                    pull away from the edges of the baking pan. Poke holes into the cake with a fork, and 
                    pour the milk mixture over the entire cake until absorbed. Let the cake cool fully.</li>
                <li>You can then put your topping on the top of the cake and serve, or keep refrigerated 
                    for up to three days. I love to eat this cake right after I make it, but it does also 
                    get better with age.</li>
